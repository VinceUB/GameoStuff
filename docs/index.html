        <p>This is just some game that I haven't worked on in a while. The full documentation about the game and what I've done so far is <a href="https://github.com/vkb24312/GameoStuff/">here</a>, and so is the repository.</p>
        <p>feel free to commit to it; I might make a commit once I get back to coding, but its been a few months and I don't currently have a computer to work on :/</p>
